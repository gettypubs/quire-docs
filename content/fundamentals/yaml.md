### YAML syntax basics

In pages with the extension `.md`, YAML block entries can be in any order. It doesn't matter if you write:

```
---
title: Cheatsheet
type: page
---
```
Or:

```
---
type: page
title: Cheatsheet
---
```

You’ll also notice that YAML values don’t necessarily need to be in quotes. `title: My Chapter`, without *My Chapter* in quotes, works just fine. However, certain formatting and characters (like colons within the text, or lines leading off with asterisks meant to italicize some of the text) can cause issues. In these cases, double quotes can minimize build issues: `title: "My Chapter"`.

```yaml
item: "If the text here has a colon : or other special characters it should be surrounded in double quotes"
```
[note/tip] Anything at all can go within double-quotes, except for other double-quotes. If you need double-quotes, use “curly quotes”, use a backslash to escape the double quote `\"` or Hugo will also process two single straight quotes '' as a double when building the pages.

Dashes represent individual items in a list. In the example below, there are two contributors, each with a first and last name. Note too, indentations matter in YAML.

```yaml
item:
other_item:
multiple_items:
  - item_name:
    item_description:
  - item_name:
    item_description:
```

YAML can include multiple, markdown-style paragraphs by using a pipe character, dropping down a line, and indenting one level. This can be used in areas like captions, descriptions, and abstracts.

```yaml
item: |
  Using a pipe character, and then dropping down a line and indenting like this allows you to include multiple paragraphs, just as you would in Markdown.

  Not all Quire YAML attributes expect Markdown though, so check the docs.

  - Markdown style lists
  - and other formatting are
  - also allowed
```

[note/tip] It’s always a good idea to copy and paste your YAML blocks into a validator like [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/) or [Code Beautify validator](https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator) to make sure there aren’t any hidden errors. You don’t need to use the re-formatted YAML validators like this will sometimes give back to you, you just need to make sure it’s correctly formatted.
