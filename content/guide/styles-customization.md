The look and feel of your Quire publication can be customized at four different levels of complexity: 1. changing style variables in the theme, 2. adding new style rules to the `custom.css` file, 3. overriding specific theme templates[&] with your own custom version, or 4. creating an entirely new Quire theme.

## Changing the Style Variables in the Theme

Every Quire project has a theme[&] inside the `themes` directory. When you first start a new project typing the `quire new` command in your command line interface, the default theme included is `quire-starter-theme`. In it, you can access simple text variables[&] that will let you update text and background colors, some element sizes, fonts, paragraph indents and more.

To find the variables, open the `quire-starter-theme` directory, navigate to the `source` sub-directory and then `css`, and open the file called `variables.scss`.

{{< q-figure id="1.9" >}}

The variables[&] are prefixed with a dollar sign and are descriptive of what they control. For instance `$quire-navbar-background-color` is the background color of the navigation bar at the top of every page. To make it red, you could enter:

```
$quire-navbar-background-color: red;
```

Colors are expressed a number of different ways, none of which are better or more supported than the others, so you can use your preference. Most common are:

- The standard 140 color keywords[&] such as `red`, `royalblue` and `honeydew`
- The many possible HEX color values[&] like `#FF0000`, `#4169E1` and `#F0FFF0`
- RGB color values[&] like `rgb(255, 0, 0)`, `rgb(65, 105, 225)` and `rgb(240, 255, 240)`

The `quire-starter-theme` uses the Bulma CSS framework, so you can also use any Bulma variables[&].

[Note] You must have the `quire preview` command running in your command line interface to see changes you make to the `variables.scss` file. You may also sometimes need to refresh your browser page, or even clear the browser cache to get the style changes to fully load.

## Adding Custom Styles

In your project’s `static` directory, there is a `css` directory with a blank `custom.css` file.

{{< q-figure id="1.10" >}}

Any CSS[&] you add here, will be added to your site’s styles. For example, let’s say you’d like a particular line of text in one of your Markdown files[&] to be red. You could wrap that text in `<span>` HTML tags and give it a class.

```html
<span class="red-text">This text should be red</span>
```

And then in your `custom.css` file, add a style rule for that class:

```css
.red-text {
  color: red;
}
```

Custom CSS[&] like this can also be used in conjunction with the `q-class` shortcode. While you can add `<span>` HTML tags within lines and paragraphs of text, in Markdown you can’t do the same with `<div>` or `<section>` tags across multiple paragraphs. Instead, you can use the `q-class` shortcode to assign any class to all the Markdown within the opening and closing shortcode tags.

```go
{{< q-class "red-text" >}}

This entire paragraph should be red.

As should the paragraph after it.

{{< /q-class >}}
```

Styles added to the `custom.css` file will also override any existing styles already in use in your theme[&]. For example, the following option would apply the style to any element with a class[&] of `"title"` anywhere in your publication.

```css
.title {
  color: red;
}
```

To determine the selectors for any element[&], in your browser of choice with your publication previewing, control-click (Mac) or right click (PC) on the element and select "Inspect element". This will show you the HTML markup for your site, along with all the class[&] names and elements, and even the styles that are currently being applied to that element[&].

The more specific you can be with your CSS selectors[&], the more likely the style will only be applied to the specific element you want. For example, if you wanted the page title on specific page to be a different color than the titles all the rest of the pages, you could determine the CSS selector[&] for that element on that page and apply a style rule to it without changing the styles on any other element or page. This example limits the style to the title in the page header of that one page:

```css
#chapter-one .quire-page__header .title {
  color: red;
}
```

In the above example, we are selecting the element with a class[&] of `"title"` that is inside an element with the class of `"quire-page__header"` (both of which start with a period `.` to indicate class[&]), that is inside an element[&] (in this case an element representing the page itself) with an id[&] of `"#chapter-one"` (which starts with a hashmark to indicate id).

[note]In Quire, page ids are unique, and can be found on the `<div>` element that has the class[&] `"quire-primary"`. By using the id[&] in your custom CSS[&], you are targeting only that page, not all `"quire-primary"` elements[&] throughout your publication.

[note]Exceptionally, if somewhere there is a more specific CSS selector[&] that’s applying a style to an element, it will override the less specific one even if it’s in your `custom.css` file. If you are trying to apply a more global style change like this and you find it’s not working, it may be because your CSS selector[&] is too generic and there is a more specific rule elsewhere in your theme’s styles that is overriding your more general one. The "Inspect element" tool will point to what combination of CSS selectors are actually applying the final style as it’s seen in the browser window.

## Overriding Theme Templates

CSS[&] changes like those mentioned above are best for re-styling existing elements. If though you’d like to make a more structural change, say, to rearrange elements on the page, or add new elements altogether, you’ll need to alter the template[&] files that come in the theme[&]. That said, other than changing the variables[&] in `variables.scss` file, as described above, it’s usually best not to make other changes directly in the theme itself. By not doing so, it’s much easier to update your theme or switch out other themes later, not to mention easier to undo changes you’ve made.

For modest changes to the theme templates[&], we recommend creating new override files. Much like the `custom.css` file can be used to override styles in the project theme, you can also have files to override templates. There are none in the default starting project, so you’ll need to start be creating a new `layouts` directory folder in the main directory of your project. Any files you put in this `layouts` directory will override the corresponding files in the `layouts` directory of your theme. This includes page templates, partial templates and shortcodes.

For example, let’s say you want to customize the layout of all the pages in your project with the `type` of `"essay"`. In the theme `layouts` directory you’ll find that there’s a sub-directory called `essay` with a file in it called `single.html`. This is the template that controls the `"essay"` pages. You can see there’s a page header, an abstract the main content `(.Content)` of the Markdown file[&] and a page bibliography.

```go
{{ define "main" }}
<article class="quire-page" id="main" role="main">

  {{ partial "page-header.html" . }}

  {{ if .Params.abstract }}
  {{ partial "page-abstract.html" . }}
  {{ end }}

  <section id="content" class="section quire-page__content">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="content">
        {{ .Content }}
        {{ partial "page-bibliography.html" . }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

</article>
{{ end }}
```

If you copy the `essay` sub-directory and its `single.html` file into the new `layouts` directory in your project’s main directory, this copy will override anything in the theme[&]. So, if you delete the bibliography and rearrange the header and abstract in the copied file, that’s what Quire will use when building the site. It only changes the style of the header and abstract of your pages while the bibliography style remains intact.

```go
{{ define "main" }}
<article class="quire-page" id="main" role="main">

  {{ if .Params.abstract }}
  {{ partial "page-abstract.html" . }}
  {{ end }}

  {{ partial "page-header.html" . }}

  <section id="content" class="section quire-page__content">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="content">
        {{ .Content }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

</article>
{{ end }}
```

By default, Quire has a number of pre-defined page types like `"essay"`, `"entry"`, and `"cover"`. To create a new page type, you would follow the model of the `"essay"` page type above, and create a directory with the name of the type and in that, have a file called `single.html` with the template[&].

Whether in the theme[&] or in your project directory, all shortcodes go in the `layouts` directory and `shortcodes` sub-directory. The name of the shortcode file corresponds to the way the shortcode is called in the Markdown files[&]. So `q-figure.html` is the shortcode `{{< q-figure >}}`.

And if you make a mistake or change your mind later, you can simply delete the copy of the file and Quire will go back to using the original template as provided in the theme. This method can also be used to add completely new templates and even new shortcodes.
